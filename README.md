# BlackChat

A simple php-based chat using some jQuery and writing to chatlog.html. Been using it at work to chat with a handful of collegues. It doesn't scale and beware that resource-hungry setInterval() function at the end for refreshing the chat window contents.

## Contents / Inhalt

chatlog.html (keeps what was written)

index.php (does all the work)

post.php (writing msg to chatlog)

style.css (it's obvious, c'mon)

Just upload it to your webserver (or your local server with e.g. xampp).
